## rust-as-a-product

A personal, evolving guide for writing Rust code with long-term maintainability, clarity, and ergonomics in mind.  
This project reflects my approach to treating code not just as an implementation detail but as a thoughtful product shaped for future readers, collaborators, and maintainers.
